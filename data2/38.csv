It would be a thrill for anyone to be invited to speak at a Stanford commencement， but it's especially gratifying for us. Stanford is rapidly becoming the favorite university for members of our family， and it's long been a favorite university for Microsoft and our foundation.我和梅琳达怀着激动的心情与你们欢聚在此共贺毕业。能受邀到斯坦福大学学位授予典礼上做演讲是一件让人激动的事，对我们而言，这尤为荣幸。斯坦福大学正日渐成为我们家庭成员最喜爱的大学。而长久以来，斯坦福也是微软以及比尔与梅琳达基金会最喜爱的一所大学。”Our formula has been to get the smartest， most creative people working on the most important problems. It turns out that a disproportionate number of those people are at Stanford. (Cheers).我们一直致力于让最聪颖有创造力的人攻克最为重要的问题。结果证明，一大部分这样的人才都来自于斯坦福校园。(欢呼)Right now， we have more than 30 foundation research projects underway here. When we want to learn more about the immune system to help cure the worst diseases， we work with Stanford. When we want to understand the changing landscape of higher education in the United States， so that more low-income students get college degrees， we work with Stanford. This is where genius lives. 如今，我们在这里进行着30多个研究项目。当我们想要通过对免疫系统的研究来寻找治愈世界上最可怕疾病的方法，我们需要斯坦福。当我们需要通过对美国高等教育的研究来帮助低收入学生上大学时，我们亦需要斯坦福。这便是人才的摇篮。There's a flexibility of mind here， an openness to change， an eagerness for what's new. This is where people come to discover the future， and have fun doing it.在这里，有着灵活的思维，对于改变的开放态度以及对新鲜事物的渴求。在这里，人们善于发现新事物，并乐享这份经历。MELINDA GATES: Now， some people call you all nerds and we hear that you claim that label with pride. (Cheers and Applause).梅琳达?盖茨：当下，一些人用书呆子这样词语称呼你们，而我们听说你们正为这个称呼而倍感骄傲。(欢呼和掌声)BILL GATES: Well， so do we. (Cheers and Applause).比尔盖茨：嗯，我们与你们同在。(欢呼和掌声)BILL GATES: My normal glasses really aren't all that different. (Laughter).比尔盖茨：我的这副普通眼镜也没多大差异嘛。(笑声)There are so many remarkable things going on here at this campus， but if Melinda and I had to put into one word what we love most about Stanford， it's the optimism.There's an infectious feeling here that innovation can solve almost every problem.That's the belief that drove me in 1975 to leave a college in the suburbs of Boston and go on an endless leave of absence.(Laughter).在这所校园中，每时每刻都有非凡的事件发生，但如果要我和梅琳达用一个词来表达对斯坦福的挚爱，那便是“乐观”。这是一种极富感染力的乐观精神，那便是，所有的问题在创新之下都能迎刃而解。这便是驱使我在1975年离开波士顿郊区的大学，并永远辍学的一个动力。(笑声)I believed that the magic of computers and software would empower people everywhere and make the world much， much better.当时的我相信计算机和软件的魔力能够赋予全世界人民以力量，并能够让这个世界变得更加美好。It's been 40 years since then， and 20 years since Melinda and I were married.We are both more optimistic now than ever. But on our journey， our optimism evolved.据那时算起，已有40年之久，我和梅琳达喜结连理也有20年之远了。这些年间，我们都比过去更为乐观开朗，但是在这些人生之旅中，我们的乐观也实现了进化。We would like to tell you what we learned and talk to you today about how your optimism and ours can do more for more people.When Paul Allen and I started Microsoft， we wanted to bring the power of computers and software to the people， and that was the kind of rhetoric we used.One of the pioneering books in the field had a raised fist on the cover， and it was called ""Computer Lib.""我们今天很想与大家分享我们所学到的一切，并和你们聊聊我们的和你们的乐观精神怎样为更多的人服务。当初和保罗创立微软之时，我们的目标是把计算机和软件的力量普及到普通大众，这便是我们当时的说法。在早期的一本书上的封面有一个上扬的拳头，他们称之为《计算机解放》。At that time， only big businesses could buy computers.We wanted to offer the same power to regular people and democratize computing.在那个时候，只有大企业才能购置计算机。我们想让这种计算机设备普及到社会大众并让计算机民主化。By the 1990s， we saw how profoundly personal computers could empower people， but that success created a new dilemma.If rich kids got computers and poor kids didn't， then technology would make inequality worse.That ran counter to our core belief.在上个世纪90年代，我们目睹了个人电脑对人们的巨大效用，但是这种成功同时造成了新的困局。如果富人的孩子拥有计算机而穷人的孩子却不能时，这种科技会加剧不平等。而这与我们的核心理念相抵触。Technology should benefit everyone.科技应当惠及万众。So we worked to close the digital divide. I made it a priority at Microsoft， and Melinda and I made it an early priority at our Foundation. Donating personal computers to public libraries to make sure that everyone had access.因此我们应当努力缩小这种差距。我将它定位为微软的首要任务，也是我和梅琳达在建立基金会之初的首要任务。为公众图书馆捐献个人电脑从而确保人人都能有机会使用。The digital divide was a focus of mine in 1997， when I took my first trip to South Africa. I went there on business so I spent most of my time in meetings in downtown Johannesburg. I stayed in the home of one of the richest families in South Africa.当我在1997年首次出访南非时，我便开始关注“数码鸿沟”。因公事出差的我将大部分时间都花费在约翰内斯堡的市区开会中。当时我住在南非最富裕的一户家庭中。It had only been three years since the election of Nelson Mandela marked the end of apartheid. When I sat down for dinner with my hosts， they used a bell to call the butler. After dinner， the women and men separated and the men smoked cigars. I thought， good thing I read Jane Austen， or I wouldn't have known what was going on. (Laughter).那时距离尼尔森?曼德拉上台，并结束种族隔离只有3年。当我同主人共进晚餐时，他们使用铃铛来使唤管家。在晚饭后，男女相互分开而男人们开始抽雪茄。当时我想，幸好我读过简?奥斯汀的书否则我就不知道发生了什么。(笑声)But the next day I went to Soweto， the poor township southwest of Johannesburg， that had been the center of the anti-apartheid movement. It was a short distance from the city into the township， but the entry was sudden， jarring and harsh.但在第二天我去了索韦托，约翰内斯堡西南的一个贫穷小镇，那里曾经是反种族隔离的中心。尽管从约翰内斯堡到索韦托路程不长，但从进入索韦托的那一刻起，一切都令人无比震惊。I passed into a world completely unlike the one I came from. My visit to Soweto became an early lesson in how naive I was. Microsoft was donating computers and software to a community center there. The kind of thing we did in the United States.我觉得我来到了一个和我所来自的地方截然不同的世界。索韦托之行让我很早便意识到自己竟是如此天真。微软向那里的一个社区中心捐赠计算机和软件。和我们在美国所做的一切相同。But it became clear to me， very quickly， that this was not the United States.但是我很快明白了，这里并不是美国。I had seen statistics on poverty， but I had never really seen poverty.The people there lived in corrugated tin shacks with no electricity， no water， no toilets. Most people didn't wear shoes. They walked barefoot along the streets， except there were no streets， just ruts in the mud.我曾经阅览过有关贫穷的调查数据，但是却未曾目睹过贫穷。那里的人们住在用铁皮搭成的简陋棚户里，没有电，没有自来水，也没有厕所。人们几乎不穿鞋，赤脚行走。或者可以说根本没有街道，只是一些坑洼的泥土路。The community center had no consistent source of power. So they rigged up an extension cord that ran 200 feet from the center to the diesel generator outside. Looking at this setup， I knew the minute the reporters left， the generator would get moved to a more urgent task. And the people who used the community center would go back to worrying about challenges that couldn't be solved by a personal computer.由于社区中心没有持续供电的设施，所以他们安装了一根延长线连接到200英尺以外的柴油发电机上。看过了这些装置，我明白了一旦记者离开后，发电机将会被运用到更紧迫的任务上。使用社区中心的人们也会因此而离开，为电脑所不能解决的问题而担忧。When I gave my prepared remarks to the press， I said Soweto is a milestone. There are major decisions ahead about whether technology will leave the developing world behind. This is to close the gap.当我向媒体道出已准备好的发言时，我谈到索韦托的经历对我而言是一个里程碑，我们所面临的重大决定是科技是否会让发展中国家落后。这也便是要缩小差距。But as I read those words， I knew they weren't super relevant. What I didn't say was， by the way， we're not focused on the fact that half a million people on this continent are dying every year from malaria. But we are sure as hell going to bring you computers.但当我说出这些词时，我发现他们并不是如此相关。我没有说的是，“顺便说一下，我们并没有注意到这个大洲上每年都会有50万人死于疟疾的事实。”但我们还是万分确信我们会为他们带来计算机。Before I went to Soweto， I thought I understood the world's problems but I was blind to many of the most important ones. I was so taken aback by what I saw that I had to ask myself， did I still believe that innovation could solve the world's toughest problems? I promised myself that before I came back to Africa， I would find out more about what keeps people poor.在我去索韦托之前，我认为自己很理解这个世界存在的问题，可那时我才明白我忽视了最重要的问题，我不停问自己‘你还认为创新能解决世界上最棘手的问题吗?’我向自己保证，在重回非洲之前，会找到更多让人们贫穷的原因。Over the years， Melinda and I did learn more about the pressing needs of the poor.数年来，我和梅琳达确实发现了穷人们的当务之需。On a later trip to South Africa， I paid a visit to a hospital for patients with MDR-TB， multi-drug resistant tuberculosis， a disease with a cure rate of under 50%. I remember that hospital as a place of despair.在后来一次到南非的时候，我去了一家住有很多抗药性肺结核患者和耐多药结核病患者的医院，这是一种治愈率不到50%的顽疾。我还记得那个充满绝望的地方。It was a giant open ward， with a sea of patients shuffling around in pajamas， wearing masks. There was one floor just for children， including some babies lying in bed. They had a little school for kids who were well enough to learn， but many of the children couldn't make it， and the hospital didn't seem to know whether it was worth it to keep the school open.在一个巨大的开放性病房里，住着很多很多病人，他们穿着睡衣，带着口罩，慢慢挪动着。有一层楼是专为孩童开设的，其中包括还在卧床的婴儿们。医院中也为适龄儿童设有小学校，但是大多数孩子都无法战胜病魔踏入学堂，因此医院似乎并不确信是否有必要开设这所学校。I talked to a patient there in her early 30s. She had been a worker at a TB hospital when she came down with a cough. She went to a doctor and he told her said she had drug-resistant TB. She was later diagnosed with AIDS. She wasn't going to live much longer， but there were plenty of MDR patients waiting to take her bed when she vacated it. This was hell with a waiting list.我同一位30多岁的病人做了交谈，并了解到她曾肺结核医院的一名职工，因为咳嗽而病倒。她看了医生，医生告诉她患上了耐药性结核病，在后来也被诊断患有艾滋。她活不了过久了，但有很多耐多药结核病患者却“觊觎”着她即将空出的床位。这是一个有很多候场病人的地狱。But seeing this hell didn't reduce my optimism. It channeled it. I got into the car as I left and I told the doctor we were working with I know MDR-TB is hard to cure， but we must do something for these people. And， in fact， this year， we are entering phase three with the new TB drug regime for patients who respond， instead of a 50% cure rate after 18 months for $2，000， we get an 80% cure rate after six months for under $100. (Applause).但是目睹了这个地域并不能减少我的乐观心态，相反，它指导着乐观的前行。在我们离开时，我在车里跟与我们同行的医生说，我虽然知道耐多药结核病是一种顽疾，但我们必须为这些人做一些实事。实际上，在今年，我们进入了新结核药物研发的第三阶段，对于那些病人而言，他们不再需为18个月50%的治愈率而花费2000美元，我们的新药物花费不超100美元便能在6个月后实现80%的治愈率。(掌声)Optimism is often dismissed as false hope. But there is also false hopelessness. That's the attitude that says we can't defeat poverty and disease. We absolutely can.乐观常被视为错误的希望。但是错误的无望也存在于世，那就是我们无法击败贫困和疾病的态度。但我们却能够做到。MELINDA GATES: Bill called me that day after he visited the TB hospital and normally if one of us is on an international trip， we will go through our agenda for the day and who we met and where we have been. But this call was different.在比尔去过结核病医院后，他曾给我致电。(因为)惯例上当我们其中一个出国的话，我们都会聊聊这天我们遇到的人和我们去过的地方。但是这番电话有些特别。Bill said to me， Melinda， I have been somewhere that I have never been before. And then he choked up and he couldn't go on. And he finally just said， I will tell you more when I get home. And I knew what he was going through because when you see people with so little hope， it breaks your heart.比尔说，梅琳达，我(今天)去了一个我之前从未去过的地方。然后他哽咽地说不出话了。他最后只是说，等我回来了再详细告诉你。(其实)我知道他经历了什么，因为当你看到濒临绝望的人们，他会让你十分悲痛。But if you want to do the most， you have to go see the worst， and I've had days like that too. About ten years ago， I traveled with a group of friends to India. And on last day I was there， I had a meeting with a group of prostitutes and I expected to talk to them about the risk of AIDS that they were facing， but what they wanted to talk to me about was stigma.但是如果你想做得更多，你必须要看到最坏的情况，我也经历过那些日子。大概十年前，我和一群朋友去印度旅游。在我临走的那一天，我和一群妓女进行了交谈，我希望跟她们讲她们所面对得艾滋病的风险，但是她们想跟我聊的只是(作为妓女的)耻辱。Many of these women had been abandoned by their husbands. That's why they even went into prostitution. They wanted to be able to feed their children. They were so low in the eyes of society that they could be raped and robbed and beaten by anyone， even the police， and nobody cared.这当中的很多人都是被她们的丈夫所抛弃。这就是为什么她们去卖淫的原因。她们想养活自己的孩子。他们在社会的眼中是如此卑微，以致于她们可以被任何人甚至是警察强奸，抢劫，甚至挨揍，(而)根本没有人会在意(她们)Talking to them about their lives was so moving to me， but what I remember most was how much they wanted to be touched. They wanted to touch me and to be touched by them. It was if physical contact somehow proved their worth. And so before I left， we linked arms hand in hand and did a photo together.聊起她们的生活让我感触至深。但是我印象最深的就是她们多么想接触他人。她们希望触摸我，也希望让我能去触碰她们也许是通过这种身体上的触碰证明了她们存在的价值。所以当我离开之前，我们肩并肩，手牵手，一起照了相。Later that same day， I spent some time in India in a home for the dying. I walked into a large hall and I saw rows and rows of cot and every cot was attended to except for one， that was far off in the corner. And so I decided to go over there.之后在那天，我去了印度的一个弥留者的家中。我走进大厅，我看见一排排的床，除了远在角落的一张床，每张床都有人在照顾。所以我决定过去看看。The patient who was in this room was a woman in her 30s. And I remember her eyes. She had these huge， brown， sorrowful eyes. She was emaciated and on the verge of death. Her intestines were not holding anything and so the workers had they put a pan under her bed， and cut a hole in the bottom of the bed and everything in her was just pouring out into that pan. And I could tell that she had AIDS. Both in the way she looked and the fact that she was off in this corner alone.这位病人是一个30岁左右的妇女。我还记得她的眼睛的样子。她有着大而悲伤的棕色的眼睛。当时的她如此憔悴并且徘徊在死亡的边缘。她的肠道里什么东西也盛不下，所以那里的工作人员就在她的床下放了一个盘子，然后在床的底部开了个洞，这样一切东西就能倾泻到那个盘子中。我看得出她得了艾滋病。不仅可以从她的外表，而且也可以从她独自在这个角落中看出来。The stigma of AIDS is vicious， especially for women. And the punishment is abandonment. When I arrived at her cot， I suddenly felt completely and totally helpless. I had absolutely nothing I could offer this woman. I knew I couldn't save her. But I didn't want her to be alone. So I knelt down with her and I put my hand out and she reached for my hand and grabbed it and she wouldn't let it go. I didn't speak her language and I couldn't think of what I should say to her. And finally I just said to her， it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. It's not your fault.得艾滋病令人声名狼藉，特别是对女性。并且得病的惩罚就是被抛弃。当我走进她床边时，我突然感觉彻底的无力和无助感。我无能为力实施帮助。我知道我不能救活她。但是我不想让她独自一人(死去)。所以我跪下来然后伸出手，她摸到我的手然后就抓住，不松开。我不会说她们的语言而且我也不知道我能对她说什么。最后我只是对她说，一切都会好起来的。一切都会好起来的。这不是你的错。And after I had been with her for sometime， she started pointing to the roof top. She clearly wanted to go up and I realized the sun was going down and what she wanted to do was go up on the roof top and see the sunset. So the workers in this home for the dying were very busy and I said to them， you know， can we take her up on the roof top? No. No. We have to pass out medicines. So I waited that for that to happen and I asked another worker and they said， No no no， we are too busy. We can't get her up there. And so finally I just scooped this woman up in my arms.在我陪着她待了一会之后，她的手指向了屋顶。很显然她很想上屋顶，而我发现太阳快要落山了，所以她想做的就是等上屋顶并且看日落。那时房子里的工作人员非常忙碌，然后我对他们说，我们能不能把她抬到屋顶上?不行。我们现在必须要分派药物。所以我就等着他们分派药物，然后我又问了另外的工作人员，他们说不行，我们太忙了。我们不能抬她上去。所以，最后我就把她抱在了怀中。She was nothing more than skin over bones and I took her up on the roof top， and I found one of those plastic chairs that blows over in a light breeze. I put her there， sat her down， put a blanket over her legs and she sat there facing to the west， watching the sunset. The workers knew -- I made sure they knew that she was up there so that they would bring her down later that evening after the sun went down and then I had to leave.她不过是骨瘦如柴，我就抱着她上了屋顶。找到了一个在微风的吹拂下响着的破旧不堪塑料凳。我把她放在椅子上，拿一个毛毯盖住她的腿，然后她就坐在那里望向西边，看着日落。工作人员知道她在屋顶上，我确保他们知道并且会在日落以后把她带下来。而不久后我就要离开。But she never left me. I felt completely and totally inadequate in the face of this woman's death. But sometimes， it's the people that you can't help that inspire you the most.但是她从未离开过我。我感到彻底的无力去面对这位妇女的死亡。但是有时，就正是这些你不能帮助的人群给了你最大的激励。I knew that those sex workers I had met in the morning could be the woman that I carried upstairs later that evening. Unless we found a way to defy the stigma that hung over their lives.我知道早上我碰到的那些性工作者将来可能就会是那天夜晚我抱上屋顶妇女的样子。除非我们找到一个方法来对抗这个羁绊她们一生的耻辱。Over the past ten years， our Foundation has helped sex workers build support groups so they could empower one another to speak up and demand safe sex and that their clients use condoms. Their brave efforts have helped to keep HIV prevalence low among sex workers and a lot of studies show that's the big reason why the AIDS epidemic has not exploded in India.过去的十年中，我们的基金已经帮助性工作者建立了支持小组，那样她们可以互相协助，要求安全的性行为，让客户就使用安全套。正是因为性服务者们勇敢的努力保持了性工作者的低HIV感染率，并且很多研究表明这就是为什么印度没有大范围地爆发艾滋病的一个重要原因。When these sex workers gathered together to help stop AIDS transmission， something unexpected and wonderful happened. The community they formed became a platform for everything. Police and others who raped and robbed them couldn't get away with it anymore. The women set up systems to encourage savings for one another and with those savings， they were able to leave sex work. This was all done by people that society considered the lowest of the low.如果这些性工作者一起帮助阻止艾滋病的传播，就会发生意想不到的好事。她们形成的这个社区成为了一个任何事互相协助的平台。警察和其他任何强奸或者抢劫她们的人都不可能无法无天。妇女们组建起了互相鼓励储蓄财产的系统，这样有了足够的储蓄，她们就可以离开性服务行业。这就是那些在社会上被视作底层中的最下等人做的事情。Optimism， for me， is not a passive expectation that things are going to get better. For me， it's a conviction and a belief that we can make things better. So no matter how much suffering we see， no matter how bad it is， we can help people if we don't lose hope help and if we don't look away. (Applause).对我而言，乐观并非消极地期待事情会变好而是一种相信事情会做的更好的确信和信念。因此不管我们目睹了怎样的痛苦，不管事态如何糟糕，如果我们没有失去希望不转头而去，那么我们便能伸出援手。(掌声)BILL GATES: Melinda and I have described some devastating scenes， but we want to make the strongest case we can for the power of optimism. Even in dire situations， optimism fuels innovation and leads to new approaches that eliminate suffering. But if you never really see the people that are suffering， your optimism can't help them. You will never change their world. And that brings me to what I see is a paradox.比尔盖茨：我和梅琳达描述了几个最为在男性的画面，但是我们还是要尽量强调乐观的力量。即使是在绝境之中，乐观也会加速创新，产生新的避免痛苦的方法。但是如果你从未看过那些痛苦折磨着的人时，你的乐观也将无能为力。你也将不会改变他们的世界。这让我想到了我眼中的一个悖论。The modern world is an incredible source of innovation and Stanford stands at the center of that， creating new companies， new schools of thought， prize-winning professors， inspired art and literature， miracle drugs， and amazing graduates. Whether you are a scientist with a new discovery， or working in the trenches to understand the needs of the most marginalized， you are advancing amazing breakthroughs in what human beings can do for each other.现代社会拥有无与伦比的创新精神，而斯坦福大学正处在创新的核心。斯坦福孕育了许许多多的新公司，有思想的学校，硕果累累的教授，富有灵感的艺术文化，创新的软件，药品，还有优秀的毕业生。无论你是收获新发现的科学家，还是在深沟中了解社会最边缘人的需求，你都在为人类相互间的协作做出惊人的突破。At the same time， if you ask people across the United States is the future going to be better than the past， most say no. My kids will be worse off than I am. They think innovation won't make the world better for them or their children.同时，如果你问全美国的人——未来回避过去更好吗?大部分人会说不，我的孩子不如我优秀。他们认为创新不会让自己或孩子的世界更好。So who is right? The people who say innovation will create new possibilities and make the world better? Or the people who see a trend toward inequality and a decline in opportunity and don't think innovation will change that?那么谁是对的?是那些说创新产生新机遇让世界更好的人么?还是那些目睹不平衡的趋势，目睹机遇减少且不指望创新带来改变的人呢?The pessimists are wrong， in my view. But they are not crazy. If innovation is purely market driven， and we don't focus on the big inequities， then we could have amazing advances and in inventions that leave the world even more divided. We won't improve cure public schools， we won't cure malaria， we won't end poverty. We won't develop the innovations poor farmers need to grow food in a changing climate.在我看来，悲观者是错误的。但是他们并不疯狂。如果创新仅凭市场驱动，我们都不关注不公正现象，那么我们的重大发明将令世界的两极分化更加严重。我们不会改善公立学校，我们不会治愈疟疾，更不会终止贫穷。我们不会研发出让贫困农民在气候变化中也能种出植物的发明。If our optimism doesn't address the problems that affect so many of our fellow human beings， then our optimism needs more empathy. If empathy channels our optimism， we will see the poverty and the disease and the poor schools. We will answer with our innovations and we will surprise the pessimists.如果我们的乐观无法用来解决那些影响许许多多同胞的问题，那么这种乐观主义还需要融入更多的移情元素。如果我们能在乐观中融入同情，我们就能解决贫困，疾病以及教育匮乏的问题。我们会以创新作答，并震惊那些悲观主义者。Over the next generation， you， Stanford graduates， will lead a new wave of innovation. Which problems will you decide to solve? If your world is wide， you can create the future we all want. If your world is narrow， you may create the future the pessimists fear.在下一代中，你们，这些斯坦福毕业生，将开启一波创新的新潮。你们会决定解决哪些问题呢?如果你的世界很宽，那么就能创造出我们理想的未来。如果你的世界很狭隘，就会造出悲观者恐惧的未来。I started learning in Soweto， that if we are going to make our optimism matter to everyone， and empower people everyone， we have to see the lives of those most in need. If we have optimism， without empathy， then it doesn't matter how much we master the secrets of science.正如我在索维托所学到的，如果我们要让自己的乐观影响所有人，并赋予他们力量，我们就要看到他们最紧迫的需求。如果我们的乐观没有融入同情，那么我们掌握多少科学秘密也没有任何用处。We are not really solving problems. We are just working on puzzles. I think most of you have a broader world view than I had at your age. You can do better at this than I did. If you put your hearts and minds to it， you can surprise the pessimists. We are eager to see it. (Applause).我们都解决不了世界上的难题。我们只是在玩智力游戏罢了。我想，你们中的大多数人比当时的我视野更宽广。你们会比曾经的我做得更出色。如果你们全身心地投身于此，你们便能震惊那些悲观者。我们对之迫不及待。(掌声)MELINDA GATES: So let your heart break. It will change what you do with your optimism.梅琳达?盖茨：让你们的心为之而碎。这会改变你们处理乐观的方式。On a trip to south Asia， I met a desperately poor Indian woman. She had two children and she begged me to take them home with me. And when I begged her for her forgiveness she said， well then， please， just take one of them.在去南亚的旅行中，我遇见了一位贫困潦倒的印度妇女。育有两子，她后来乞求我让我把这两个孩子带走。当我祈求她原谅时，她说，那好吧，请至少带走一个也可以吧。On another trip to south Los Angeles， I met with a group of the students from a tough neighborhood. A young girl said to me， do you ever feel like we are the kids' whose parents shirked their responsibilities and we are just the leftovers? These women broke my heart.在另一个去洛杉矶南部的旅途中，我遇见了一群来自贫困社区的学生。一个年轻女孩对我说，你是不是觉得我们就是那群父母逃避责任，我们只是留守儿童呢?这些女性让我心碎。And they still do. And the empathy intensifies if I admit to myself， that could be me. When I talk with the mothers I meet during my travels， there's no difference between what we want for our children. The only difference is our ability to provide it to our children.而她们现在依然让我心碎。当我对自己承认，我也可能会是她们中的一员。我与旅途中的母亲交流时发现，我们想给予孩子的没有什么不同。唯一的不同在于我们将其给予孩子的能力。So what accounts for that difference? Bill and I talk about this with our own kids around the dinner table. Bill worked incredibly hard and he took risks and he made sacrifices for success. But there's another essential ingredient of success， and that is luck. Absolute and total luck. When were you born? Who are your parents? Where did you grow up? None of us earn these things. These things were given to us.那么差距何在呢?我和比尔曾就此问题与我们的孩子在餐桌上共同讨论。比尔工作非常努力，他冒过风险，为成功做出不少牺牲。但是还有一个成功的重要因素，那便是运气。完完全全的运气。你出生何处?你的父母是谁?你在哪里成长?没有任何人赚得这些东西，我们只是被赐予了这些东西而已。So when we strip away all of our luck and our privilege and we consider where we would be without them， it becomes someone much easier to see someone who is poor and say， that could be me. And that's empathy. Empathy tears down barriers and it opens up whole new frontiers for optimism.所以当我们剥去运气和优待，并思考没有他们我们会将如何时，这个人就更容易看到那些贫困者，并说，这可能就是我。这就是同情心，同情心抹平障碍，为乐观敞开新的大门。So here is our appeal to you all. As you leave Stanford， take all your genius and your optimism and your empathy， and go change the world in ways that will make millions of people optimistic. You don't have to rush. You have careers to launch and debts to pay and spouses to meet and marry. That's plenty enough for right now. But in the course of your lives， perhaps without any plan on your part， you will see suffering that's going to break your heart. And when it happens， don't turn away from it. That's the moment that change is born.所以这就是我们对你们所有人的呼吁。在你离开斯坦福校园之后，带着你的天分，乐观以及同情心，改变这个世界，让数百万人为之乐观起来。你无须急功近利，你还要开创事业，付清债款，找寻另一半并喜结良缘。现在就这些便足够了，但是在你们的生命之中，可能你们并未计划过，你会目睹那些让你心碎的苦楚。当这些痛苦发生时，不要掩面离开，在这一刻，改变因此而孕育。"

"这是一个新闻,新闻的关键词是全球最大太阳能飞机下一站重庆 赴南京时间推迟,摘要为全球最大的太阳能飞机“阳光动力2号”已经抵达缅甸曼德勒，下一站就是重庆。不过，南京小伙伴们想看它，还得耐心再等等。昨天，现代快报记者从江苏空,标题为全球最大太阳能飞机下一站重庆 赴南京时间推迟,正文为全球最大的太阳能飞机“阳光动力2号”已经抵达缅甸曼德勒，下一站就是重庆。不过，南京小伙伴们想看它，还得耐心再等等。昨天，现代快报记者从江苏空管分局获悉，目前，“阳光动力2号”推迟到3月25日晚上或26日凌晨抵达南京禄口机场。不过，空管方面表示，这还不是最终确定的抵达时间。在飞机未到达南京之前，他们将与飞行团队保持联系，准备迎接“阳光动力2号”。从计划的3月20日抵达南京，到目前为止，“阳光动力2号”飞抵南京的时间一再推迟。据江苏空管分局工作人员介绍，此次推迟与天气原因有关。不过，记者了解到，“阳光动力2号”抵达曼德勒的时间还提前了。“阳关动力”官博显示，北京时间3月19日21点21分，“阳光动力2号”成功降落缅甸曼德勒机场，完成环球飞行第四航段。由于遇到顺风的高速气流，实际用时13小时29分，到达时间比预计提前了不少。那么，“阳光动力2号”为何又推迟来宁呢？现代快报记者了解到，“阳光动力2号”从曼德勒到重庆飞行时间要20个小时左右。由于靠太阳能发动，它受天气影响较大。每一次起飞前，都要确定到下一站之间的天气情况。目前，缅甸进入干季，雨较少。而从缅甸飞入重庆，需要经过中国的西南部。截至昨天，天气预报显示，重庆近期阴有小雨。其中，3月23日重庆为多云转小雨天气，不适合“阳光动力2号”起降。而3月24日为小雨转多云。因此，“阳光动力2号”飞抵重庆的时间有可能还要推迟。"

"这是一个新闻,新闻的关键词是房产继承、赠予无须强制公证!轻松省下好几万,摘要为7月5日，司法部发布《关于废止司法部、建设部关于房产登记管理中加强公证的联合通知的通知》，继承、赠与房产办理登记事项可以不用“强制公证”了。,标题为房产继承、赠予无须强制公证!轻松省下好几万,正文为7月5日，司法部发布《关于废止司法部、建设部关于房产登记管理中加强公证的联合通知的通知》，继承、赠与房产办理登记事项可以不用“强制公证”了。至此，颁布于1991年、适用了25年的“强制公证”规定做法作废。 3种房屋产权变更登记无须再公证：① 继承房产。包括法定继承、遗嘱继承、协商继承和诉讼继承。② 赠与房产。③ 涉外和涉港澳台的房产所有权转移事宜。如何继承房产？根据2016年1月1日开始实施的《不动产登记暂行条例实施细则》第十四条“因继承、受遗赠取得不动产，当事人申请登记的，应当提交死亡证明材料、遗嘱或者全部法定继承人关于不动产分配的协议以及与被继承人的亲属关系材料等，也可以提交经公证的材料或者生效的法律文书。”据此，法律将公证材料作为申请人 可选择提供的内容，而 不再是“强制性”提交的必备材料。 无须公证将省下好几万据了解，办理房产赠与的公证案件绝大多数是亲属，其中以直系亲属，特别是父母对子女赠与的情况居多，原因大多是为了子女结婚，或者是老人为了生前安排好财产以避免日后发生继承纠纷。新政策实施前，当事人办理房产过户时必须提交赠与公证书或接受赠与公证书。而办理这项赠与公证要根据实际受益额，也就是房价，按阶梯比例收取一定的公证费用，这对动辄数百万的房价着实是一笔不小的费用。以福建省厦门市为例，按照《厦门市公证处公证收费标准》，办理遗嘱公证费用为100元/件，确认遗嘱效力为400元/件，而证明财产继承，赠与和遗赠，公证费按受益额的2%收取。所以，新政策实施后，仅公证一项就能为当事人省下好几万的费用。转载自中国网来源：央视新闻 央视财经"
"这是一个新闻,新闻的关键词是与创业者携手，为爱员工加油,摘要为——国内首个留人平台爱员工3月25号正式上线国内首个留人平台爱员工，是一款针对中小微企业的免费人力资源管理平台，刚在微信开放预注册报名5天时,标题为与创业者携手，为爱员工加油,正文为——国内首个留人平台爱员工3月25号正式上线国内首个留人平台爱员工，是一款针对中小微企业的免费人力资源管理平台，刚在微信开放预注册报名5天时间，就获得了700多家企业的关注。3月25日，爱员工终于正式发布了。3月25日，在广州建国酒店举办的“与创业者携手，为爱员工加油”主题发布会上，数百家创业型企业，以中华英才网、拉勾网、商业总会为代表的二十多家知名的合作企业和机构伙伴，以及投资机构出席了发布会。为什么一个没有正式发布的APP会如此受人关注呢？ 爱员工第一创始人赵杨晛先生主题演讲：与创业者携手，为爱员工加油爱员工第一创始人赵杨晛先生详细阐述了爱员工的理念，价值观，以及能为中小微企业实际带来的价值。据相关数据显示，目前中国所有注册企业中，95%为中小微企业，累计超过4500万家，留人难是所有中小微企业普遍存在的问题，严重制约着企业发展。而爱员工正是一个帮他们提升管理水平，降低人力成本的留人平台。直击长尾市场，开创新模式爱员工瞄准4500万家小微企业，这是一个未被关注的长尾市场。无数企业服务机构想要进入这个市场，但苦于运营成本高没有好的方式。爱员工基于对人力资源的深刻理解，基于对小微企业的深入分析，以免费的方式，轻便的功能，以及强大的内容找到一条进入大长尾的可行之路。开创了国内人力资源服务领域的新模式。并同时为中小微企业带来真正的价值。所以它还没有正式发布就受到追捧。直击招人、留人痛点赵杨晛认为，目前中小微企业招人难的主要原因有四点，分别是缺少品牌、缺乏资金、平台小、保障少，正是以上四点，往往让小微企业在和大企业竞争过程中，败下阵来。而留人难的背后同样也是四个关键点，分别是成长缺失，发展不好，管理不佳，福利不够。招人难和留人难形成死循环，最终为中小微企业发展带来致命危机：一方面，人才流动性居高不下，导致企业业务难继承，发展壮大不起来，另一方面，经过悉心培养出来的优秀人才因为种种原因，不断流向大企业，在伤害企业主身心的同时，进一步加剧中小微企业与大企业在人才素质方面的差距。而爱员工将透过管理、提升、沟通、参与、关爱五个方面帮助小微企业解决留人痛点。以留人为本方得始终作为面试超过10000人的资深猎头，爱员工第一创始人赵杨晛已经创业十年，所有创业型公司遭遇的人力资源问题，他都深有体会，因为理解，所以贴心。在发布会现场，他表示，爱员工创办的初衷就是要帮中小微企业成功留人。 爱员工产品总监汪锋先生激情演讲，分享爱员工产品功能作为国内首个留人平台，爱员工的每个功能都渗透着对人力资源的深刻理解，“我们”让企业内部沟通方便顺畅，“一起”则让协同办公变得灵活高效，而“成长”为中小微企业员工提供免费的精品培训课程，满足移动学习需求，让他们与企业共同成长。通过系统性的管理和大数据，最终帮助中小微企业成功做出判断，留住好员工，助力创业发展。此外，爱员工还是一款有价值观的APP。爱员工，就是好老板！未来，爱员工的“爱”板块即将正式上线，集结广大中小微企业，为他们提供免费、低价、弹性的员工福利，彻底摆脱大企业因为规模而独享的福利价格优势，让每一个在中小微企业工作的人获得尊重，获得成长，获得爱。App体验效果佳受HR认可追捧 数百家创业型企业正在认真听取爱员工的产品理念和功能作为一个拥有十年人力资源经验的资深行业工作者，爱员工产品总监汪锋现场介绍并演示爱员工APP。目前，“互联网+”时代已经到来，移动互联对传统行业的融合正在加快，随着企业组织越来越扁平化，广大中小微企业、大企业内部小团队的沟通需求越来越高，而爱员工恰恰是互联网+人力资源落地的产品模式，刚好满足创业型公司在人力资源方面的需求。此外，作为一个人力资源云平台，爱员工采用SAAS服务模式，不需要IT投入，支持APP无线扩展，真正实现移动HR办公及去中心化社交。同时，爱员工真正关注人的价值体验，每一个功能操作倾注关注、尊重、爱等情感连接，让它不仅可以用来工作，更能用来生活和学习成长。 观众现场体验爱员工APP，简单、实用、贴心的一站式人力资源服务获中小微企业从业者好评除拥有人事管理、培训成长、招聘管理等HR业务应用之外，未来，在PC端，爱员工将设置爱应用超市，满足中小微企业的业务应用添加需求；在移动端，雇主品牌、内部推荐及培训管理等功能，将真正实现爱员工在创业型公司的全员应用。现场一位从深圳赶来的人事经理唐小姐告诉记者，虽然这是第一次下载使用爱员工，但是感觉非常熟悉亲切，确实是一款很系统很简捷的HR轻应用，会很想推荐给她的HR朋友使用。乐视音乐节嘉宾开场为创业者加油本次“与创业者携手，为爱员工加油”活动一开场，来自香港的红迷乐队倾情开唱，为所有中小微企业带来原创歌曲《让你成名》，瞬间引爆现场，乐队主唱段紫晴表示，在追求音乐的道路上，红迷乐队和所有创业者一样，虽然也会遭遇沮丧彷徨，但是只要继续向前，不断坚持，就一定可以等到成名的那一天。“留着汗水不顾一切，继续疯狂，遇到挫折也不会停下，燃烧心中希望”等歌词，深深引发所有在场创业者的共鸣。现场的声音记者在现场采访了中华英才网的市场总监，其表示，爱员工是一个非常好的理念，对我们服务的客户非常有用，可以与我们的招聘产品非常好地融合，所以我们愿意将它介绍给客户。一个慕名而来的创业老板张先生也表示，爱员工的培训课程，大的培训机构可能要卖十万以上，我们现在免费就能获得，对于我们这些出不起钱培训的小企业，真是太值了。据最新数据显示，2014年，中国新注册企业超过千万家，其中超过60%保持良好的经营活跃状态， 3月20日，国家总理李克强表示，要提高这些中小微企业的活跃度，让它们活下来，活得好。作为国内首个留人平台，在2015创业潮来临之际，爱员工的正式发布，将为中小微企业提供最高效、最实用、最贴心的一站式人力资源服务，让所有创业型公司活下来，活得好！"
"这是一个新闻,新闻的关键词是移民，万人,摘要为社科院作出澄清：近三年年均移民仅19万人“去年930万人移民”说法误导公众（求证·探寻喧哗背后的真相）本报记者白天亮近日，多家媒体报道“中国,标题为社科院澄清去年930万人移民:近三年年均移民仅19万,正文为社科院作出澄清：近三年年均移民仅19万人“去年930万人移民”说法误导公众（求证·探寻喧哗背后的真相）本报记者白天亮近日，多家媒体报道“中国去年930万人移民”，并称“中国发生大规模海外移民潮，大量精英人才逃离中国加入外国国籍”。中国社科院对相关数据核实后发现，这类传言将“总量”混淆为“增量”、将“移民”等同于“入籍”。事实上，过去3年我国平均每年海外移民约19万人，我国海外移民占总人口的比例在世界上处于低位。“930万人移民”的传言从哪来回应：将“总量”混淆为“增量”，国际报告原指历年中国海外移民总量中国社科院人口与劳动经济研究所研究员高文书说，居民的跨国迁移，是世界经济发展的常态，对于我国推动人才培养、加强国际交流、提升国家影响力，具有重要意义。现在，有人认为中国发生大规模的海外移民潮，是对我国移民状况存在认识误区。高文书说，媒体报道的“中国去年930万人移民”等新闻，其数据来源是美国皮尤研究中心基于联合国经济和社会事务部“国际移民存量”数据库计算得到的。对照皮尤研究中心的报告，其原文说的是截至2013年中国的海外移民总量是930万，而不是指2013年一个年份的海外移民数量。“混淆了我国历年海外移民的""总量""和2013年当年的""增量""，严重误导了舆论。2010年至2013年，我国海外移民数量共58万人，平均每年约19万人。”高文书说。“移民”等同于“入籍”吗回应：不等同，在非本人出生国以外国家定居1年以上都可称为移民在生活中，只要提到“移民”，很多人往往理解为“入籍”了。是这样吗？记者查证发现，联合国经济和社会事务部将国际移民定义为，所有在非本人出生国以外的国家定居1年以上的人。这意味着，在国际语境下，只要是在我国出生并离开中国1年以上的居民，都将被统计为我国的海外移民。这不仅包括那些已经加入外国国籍的我国原居民，也包括那些在国外但并未加入外国国籍的我国留学生、外派员工、国际劳动者等。可见，“移民”的范围远远超出了“入籍”的范畴。2013年，我国在海外留学人员为114万人，在海外务工人员为85万人，他们也是有关机构所计算的我国海外移民的组成部分。我国海外移民突然增加了吗回应：没有，并不存在所谓的“大规模人才逃离”，我国人口外迁率较低按照联合国的统计口径，我国的海外移民总量到1990年为409万人，到2000年为549万人，到2010年为876万人，到2013年为934万人。照此计算，1990年—2000年间，我国海外移民平均每年增加14万人，年均增长3.0%；2000年—2010年间，每年增加32.7万人，年均增长4.8%；2010年—2013年间，每年增加19.3万人，年均增长2.2%。 “我国海外移民处在相对稳定的低速增长状态，并未出现短时间内突然增加，近几年还出现增速的相对下降，根本不存在所谓""大规模人才逃离""。”高文书说。我国是世界第一人口大国，但海外移民的总量并非最多。从世界排名来看，我国2013年海外移民总量居世界第四位，低于印度（1420万）、墨西哥（1320万）、俄罗斯（1080万）。从海外移民占总人口的比例来看，2013年世界平均水平为3.3%；发达国家人口外迁率较低，大多为2%—5%；发展中国家人口外迁率通常较高，一些国家高达20%以上；而我国，这一比例只有0.7%。因此，我国的人口外迁规模和迁移率都不算高，人员国际交流尚待加强而不是限制。应怎样认识人才流动回应：只关注“外流”不对比“回流”是片面的，事实上我国正进入人才回流期此前网上曾热传一个说法，称中国优秀人才流失海外，学成归国的只占少数，由此很多人认为中国的基础教育是在为国外培养人才。事实证明，这一说法只关注“外流”不对比“回流”，是十分片面的，数据也显示，我国七成留学生回国发展。2001年，我国留学回国人员为1.2万人；2005年，增加到3.5万人；2009年，进一步突破10万人大关，达到10.8万人；2013年更达到35.35万人。同期，我国出国留学人员虽然也在快速增加，但增速显著低于留学回国人员。据教育部留学服务中心回国处此前提供给本报的数据显示，1978年—2012年底，共有109.12万留学生回国发展，占出国留学人数的72.38%。2012年回国人数已达到27.29万人，同比增长46.57%。专家表示，我国的海外移民，固然有一部分长期居留在流入国，甚至加入流入国国籍，但同时从国外回流的人才也在增加，对我国的发展产生了重要推动作用。联合国开发计划署的研究显示，当教育经费占国民生产总值5%以上，研发经费占国民生产总值1.9%以上，研发人员人均研发经费达每年6万美元以上，从事研发的科学家每百万人口有1500人以上时，归国的海外人才就会大幅度增加。2012年，我国教育经费占国民生产总值的比例为4.6%，研发经费占国民生产总值的比例为2%，研发人员人均研发费用为5.2万美元，每百万人口拥有的研发人员约3000人。可见，我国的相关指标都已接近或超过联合国提出的标准。从国际经验来看，我国已经具备进入人才回流期的条件。正因为如此，高文书认为，“我国正进入人才回流期。保持和促进人才回流，应该成为我国人口国际迁移对策的重点。”链接：本报要闻四版2013年12月6日曾发表题为《“我国多数留学生未回国”等说法不实 七成留学生回国发展》的文章澄清“留学生多未归国”的不实说法。"
